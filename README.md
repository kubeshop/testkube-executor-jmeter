# JMeter Executor

## What is an Executor?

Executor is nothing more than a program wrapped into Docker container which gets JSON (testube.Execution) OpenAPI based document as an input and returns a stream of JSON output lines (testkube.ExecutorOutput),
where each output line is simply wrapped in this JSON, similar to the structured logging idea.

## Intro

It's basic JMeter executor able to run simple JMeter scenarios writer in JMX format.
Please define your JMeter file as file (string, or git file). 

Project directory is not implemented yet.

## Local development

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed on your machine and available in your PATH:
* [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi) - pure Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance

### Setup
1. Create a directory called `data/` where JMeter will run and store results (best practice is to create it in the project root because it is git-ignored)
2. Create a JMeter XML project file and save it as a file named `test-content` in the newly created `data/` directory
3. Create an execution JSON file and save it as a file named `execution.json` based on the template below (best practice is to save it in the `temp/` folder in the project root because it is git-ignored)
    ```json
    {
      "id": "jmeter-test",
      "args": [],
      "variables": {},
      "content": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
    ```
4. You need to provide the `RUNNER_SCRAPPERENABLED`, `RUNNER_SSL` and `RUNNER_DATADIR` environment variables and run the Executor using the `make run run_args="-f|--file <path>"` make command where `-f|--file <path>` argument is the path to the `execution.json` file you created in step 3.
    ```bash
    RUNNER_SCRAPPERENABLED=false RUNNER_SSL=false RUNNER_DATADIR="./data" make run run_args="-f temp/execution.json"
    ```

#### Execution JSON

Execution JSON stores information required for an Executor to run the configured tests.

Breakdown of the Execution JSON:
```json
{
   "args": ["-n", "-t", "test.jmx"],
   "variables": {
      "example": {
         "type": "basic", 
         "name": "example", 
         "value": "some-value"
     }
   },
   "content": {
      "type": "string"
   }
}
```
* **args** - array of strings which will be passed to JMeter as arguments
  * example: `["-n", "-t", "test.jmx"]`
* **variables** - map of variables which will be passed to JMeter as arguments
  * example: `{"example": {"type": "basic", "name": "example", "value": "some-value"}}` 
* **content.type** - used to specify that JMeter XML is provided as a text file

#### Environment Variables
```bash
RUNNER_SSL=false                  # used if storage backend is behind HTTPS, should be set to false for local development
RUNNER_SCRAPPERENABLED=false      # used to enable/disable scrapper, should be set to false for local development
RUNNER_DATADIR=<path-to-data-dir> # path to the data/ directory where JMeter will run and store results
```

## Testing in Kubernetes

### Prerequisites
* Kubernetes cluster with Testkube installed (best practice is to install it in the `testkube` namespace)

### Guide

After validating locally that the Executor changes work as expected, next step is to test whether Testkube can successfully schedule a Test using the new Executor image.

NOTE: The following commands assume that Testkube is installed in the `testkube` namespace, if you have it installed in a different namespace, please adjust the `--namespace` flag accordingly.

The following steps need to be executed in order for Testkube to use the new Executor image:
1. Build the new Executor image using the `make docker-build-local` command. By default, the image will be tagged as `kubeshop/testkube-executor-jmeter:999.0.0` unless a `LOCAL_TAG` environment variable is provided before the command.
2. Now you need to make the image accessible in Kubernetes, there are a couple of approaches:
   * *kind* - `kind load docker-image <image-name> --name <kind cluster name>` (e.g. `kind load docker-image testkube-executor-jmeter:999.0.0 --name testkube-k8s-cluster`)
   * *minikube* - `minikube image load <image-name> --profile <minikube profile>` (e.g. `minikube image load testkube-executor-jmeter:999.0.0 --profile k8s-cluster-test`)
   * *Docker Desktop* - just by building the image locally, it becomes accessible in the Docker Desktop Kubernetes cluster
   * *other* - you can push the image to a registry and then Testkube will pull it in Kubernetes (assuming it has credentials for it if needed)
3. Edit the Job Template and change the `imagePullPolicy` to `IfNotPresent`
   * Edit the ConfigMap `testkube-api-server` either by running `kubectl edit configmap testkube-api-server --namespace testkube` or by using a tool like Monokle
   * Find the `job-template.yml` key and change the `imagePullPolicy` field in the `containers` section to `IfNotPresent`
4. Edit the Executors configuration and change the base image to use the newly created image:
   * Edit the ConfigMap `testkube-api-server` either by running `kubectl edit configmap testkube-api-server --namespace testkube` or by using a tool like Monokle
   * Find the `executors.json` key and change the `executor.image` field to use the newly created image for the JMeter Executor (`name` field is `jmeter-executor`)
5. Restart the API Server by running `kubectl rollout restart deployment testkube-api-server --namespace testkube`

Testkube should now use the new image for the Executor and you can schedule a Test with your preferred method.
